"Given a unary test function which is applicable to characters
returns a function which yields the same boolean results for all
characters with character codes from START to (excluding) END.  If
KIND is NIL, TEST-FUNCTION will simply be returned.  Otherwise, KIND
should be one of:

* :HASH-TABLE - builds a hash table representing all characters which
                satisfy the test and returns a closure which checks if
                a character is in that hash table

* :CHARSET - instead of a hash table uses a \"charset\" which is a
             data structure using non-linear hashing and optimized to
             represent (sparse) sets of characters in a fast and
             space-efficient way (contributed by Nikodemus Siivola)

* :CHARMAP - instead of a hash table uses a bit vector to represent
             the set of characters

You can also use :HASH-TABLE* or :CHARSET* which are like :HASH-TABLE
and :CHARSET but use the complement of the set if the set contains
more than half of all characters between START and END.  This saves
space but needs an additional pass across all characters to create the
data structure.  There is no corresponding :CHARMAP* kind as the bit
vectors are already created to cover the smallest possible interval
which contains either the set or its complement.")
